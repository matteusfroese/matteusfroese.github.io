<p>This is the page for the Combinatorics and Topology Learning seminar run by me. We will broadly look at the intersection of combinatorics and topology. If this sounds crazy to you, just remember that "Algebraic Topology" used to be called "Combinatorial Topology". Each term will have a slightly different flair to it. You can find the details for the seminar each term below:</p>
<h2>Fall 2025</h2>
<p>
This term started a bit late, but we are studying the moduli space of graphs.
<br>
The location and time are Wednesdays 3:30-4:30pm in MC 6483.
<br>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Wednesday Nov 5:</b> Matteus Froese, the definition of the Moduli Space of Graphs and some applications.</li>
      <li><b>Wednesday Nov 12:</b> Matteus Froese, Questions from last week, labelled graph representations, and possible future directions.</li>
      <li><b>Wednesday Nov 19:</b> Hopefully not Matteus Froese...</li>
    </ul>
